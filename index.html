  <h1>Cats are my favorite animal</h1>  
  <h2>Why, you ask?</h2>

  <p>Cats have stayed so close to their natural instincts throughout generations of domestication. Living with a cat is like having your own miniature tiger right in your house! That's cool, right? AND best of all, legal! They're pretty darn easy to care for, too. Some food, water, and a box to eliminate in and they're set for days! They never smell bad like dogs. They're soft and snuggly, but independent and give you space when you need it; the perfect companion for an introvert. I friggin' love cats. But you don't have to.</p>
